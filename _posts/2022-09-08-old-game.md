I recently organized and directed a video project called the Shop Fusion Collab, in which I lead over 60 contributors in creating art and music in the style of 38 different games, and modding them all in. In addition to directing I did the modding/editing for 12 of the games, and did the music for 8 of them.

As of September 2023 it has over a million views.
