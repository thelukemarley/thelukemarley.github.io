I'm currently working on a puzzle game in Unity. The game has a central mechanic of objects being able to be in multiple places at the same time, and is about exploring the interesting unintended consequences of that mechanic.

The current demo can be played here: [https://blookerstein.itch.io/project-entanglement](https://blookerstein.itch.io/project-entanglement)
This is a work in progress, with placeholder visuals and no audio. I'm planning on having it complete in terms of design and programming by April 2024, and on Steam before the end of the year. At the moment I've mainly included it here to show skill in game design and my work on a solo project.

The proof of concept for this game won a National Silver Medal in Game Design at the Scholastic Art and Writing Awards.
