I worked in a group of 6 people to create a game in 48 hours. We used Unreal Engine 5 to create a small puzzle game about changing dimensions, featuring detailed environments.

* Worked with Unreal blueprints to create a dynamic interactive world
* Created a persistant dynamic music system and made all music

This game won "Best Visuals" at the 2023 Utah Indie Game Jam.
