I worked on the programming for Brigham Young Universityâ€™s 2023 game project, Solar Showdown. We used Unreal Engine 5 to create a 1v1 multiplayer game with RTS and tower defense elements.

* Worked with C++ scripts and blueprints to implement game functionality
* Worked on developing features, fixing bugs, and tuning gameplay as part of a team
