I'm currently working on a puzzle game in Unity. The game has a central mechanic of objects being able to be in multiple places at the same time, and is about exploring the interesting unintended consequences of that mechanic.

The current demo can be played here: [https://blookerstein.itch.io/project-entanglement](https://blookerstein.itch.io/project-entanglement)
This is a major work in progress, and mainly included as a way to show examples of code I've written. You can see all the C# files for the game here:

The proof of concept for this game won a National Silver Medal in Game Design at the Scholastic Art and Writing Awards.
