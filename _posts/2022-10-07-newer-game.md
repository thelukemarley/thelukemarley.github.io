I'm currently working on a puzzle game in Unity. The game has a central mechanic of objects being able to be in multiple places at the same time, and is about exploring the interesting unintended consequences of that mechanic.

This is a major work in progress, and mainly included as a way to show examples of code I've written. You can see all the C# files for the game here:

The proof of concept for this game won a National Silver Medal in Game Design at the Scholastic Art and Writing Awards.
