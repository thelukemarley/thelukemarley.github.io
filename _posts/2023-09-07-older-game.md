I'm a Computer Science major with an Animation and Games emphasis at BYU. If you're looking for someone with experience working in 3D software, I am well versed in Maya and Houdini.

I made this as an excercise in texturing in Houdini. The gourd uses complex procedural texture generation and shading.

This was modeled, textured and rendered in Maya.

This was also modeled, textured, and rendered in Maya.

This was an exercise in procedural mesh generation in Houdidi. It's a Mario 64 Gingerbread House. (The exercise focused on mesh generation, not texturing/shading/rendering.)
