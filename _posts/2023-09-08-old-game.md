I recently organized and directed a video project called the Shop Fusion Collab, in which I lead over 60 contributors in creating art and music in the style of 38 different games, and modding them all in. In addition to directing I did the modding/editing for 12 of the games, and did the music for 8 of them.

The concept is a little complex but for context, the core idea is that each section has a shopkeeper & shop theme from one game, remade as if they were in another game. The sections link together sequentially, for example it starts with the Wii Shop Channel with the Zelda: Wind Waker shopkeeper, then the shop in Zelda: Wind Waker with the Pokemmon Diamond & Pearl shopkeeper, then the shop in Pokemon D/P with the Persona 2 shopkeeper, etc. A full list of the games featured is pinned in the comments section. As of September 2023 it has over a million views.
